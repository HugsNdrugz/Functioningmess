To refactor your application into a Facebook Messenger-like app using Flask, you would need to redesign it to be more dynamic, interactive, and mobile-friendly. Here's a structured approach:


---

1. Architecture and Design

Objective

Mimic a Facebook Messenger-like interface where:

Users can browse and visualize existing data (messages, SMS, keylogs, etc.).

Conversations are sorted by contacts and organized by date.

Chat messages are displayed as chat bubbles.



Architecture Overview

Frontend: Use a modern framework like React, Vue.js, or Bootstrap templates for the Messenger-like UI.

Backend: Use Flask to serve APIs for data retrieval and processing.

Database: SQLite (as per your current setup) to store data.



---

2. Frontend (Messenger-like UI)

HTML/CSS Framework: Use Bootstrap or Materialize CSS for responsive, mobile-first designs.

UI Libraries: Use JavaScript frameworks like React or Vue.js for a highly interactive experience.

Features:

Conversations List: Show contacts sorted by the latest messages.

Chat View: Display messages as chat bubbles with timestamps.

Tabs: Include tabs to switch between Conversations, Keylogs, Calls, and Contacts.



Example with Bootstrap:

Conversations View:

<div class="conversation-list">
    <div class="contact" onclick="openChat('contact_id')">
        <img src="profile_picture.jpg" alt="Profile Picture">
        <div>
            <h5>Contact Name</h5>
            <p>Last message snippet...</p>
        </div>
        <span class="timestamp">2 mins ago</span>
    </div>
</div>

Chat View:

<div class="chat-window">
    <div class="message received">
        <p>Hello!</p>
        <span class="timestamp">10:45 AM</span>
    </div>
    <div class="message sent">
        <p>Hi, how are you?</p>
        <span class="timestamp">10:46 AM</span>
    </div>
</div>



---

3. Backend (Flask API)

Set up Flask as your backend to handle:

Data retrieval for contacts, messages, keylogs, calls, etc.

APIs for sorted and filtered data.



Flask Routes:

Conversation List:

@app.route('/api/conversations', methods=['GET'])
def get_conversations():
    # Fetch latest conversations sorted by date
    conversations = query_database("""
        SELECT contact_id, name, MAX(time) AS last_message_time
        FROM ChatMessages
        GROUP BY contact_id
        ORDER BY last_message_time DESC
    """)
    return jsonify(conversations)

Chat Messages:

@app.route('/api/chat/<contact_id>', methods=['GET'])
def get_chat(contact_id):
    messages = query_database(f"""
        SELECT time, text, sender_contact_id
        FROM ChatMessages
        WHERE contact_id = {contact_id}
        ORDER BY time ASC
    """)
    return jsonify(messages)

Tabs:

Keylogs: /api/keylogs

Calls: /api/calls

Contacts: /api/contacts




---

4. Database Structure

You already have a well-defined schema. Ensure that:

Indexes are created for fields like time and contact_id for faster querying.

Foreign keys link ChatMessages, SMS, Calls, etc., to Contacts.



---

5. Flask App Refactor

Project Structure:

app/
|-- static/         # CSS, JavaScript, Images
|-- templates/      # HTML templates
|-- app.py          # Main Flask app
|-- api_routes.py   # API endpoints
|-- db_utils.py     # Database interaction
|-- models.py       # Data models
|-- utils.py        # Utility functions

Flask Setup:

Main App (app.py):

from flask import Flask, render_template
from api_routes import api_blueprint

app = Flask(__name__)

# Register API routes
app.register_blueprint(api_blueprint, url_prefix='/api')

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template('index.html')  # Renders Messenger-like UI

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

API Routes (api_routes.py):

from flask import Blueprint
from db_utils import query_database

api_blueprint = Blueprint('api', __name__)

@api_blueprint.route('/conversations', methods=['GET'])
def conversations():
    return query_database("""
        SELECT contact_id, name, MAX(time) as last_time
        FROM ChatMessages
        GROUP BY contact_id
        ORDER BY last_time DESC
    """)



---

6. Key Features

Conversations Tab:

Combine SMS and ChatMessages tables.

Display contact names and last message snippets.

Clicking on a contact opens their messages.


Chat Messages:

Show messages in chat bubbles (different styles for sent/received).

Include timestamps.


Keylogs Tab:

List keylogs per application in a tabular format.

Use filters to narrow down by date or application.


Calls Tab:

Show call history with details (type, duration, contact).


Contacts Tab:

List all contacts with the ability to view their linked conversations.



---

7. UI Mockup

Homepage:

Default: Conversations List.

Tabs: Conversations | Keylogs | Calls | Contacts.


Conversation View:

Chat bubbles for messages.

Scrollable window.


Data Visualization:

Simple, clean tables for Keylogs, Calls, and Contacts.




---

8. Deployment

Use Gunicorn or uWSGI for production.

Frontend can be served via Flask-Static or a separate deployment (e.g., Vercel for React).



---

By combining Flask for API management, Bootstrap for responsiveness, and a tabbed navigation approach, you can deliver a modern, mobile-friendly experience that aligns with your Facebook Messenger-inspired vision.
